# ‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Shop Web Page Project ‚òïÔ∏è

This project was developed during the introductory cycle of the web development course in the FrauenLoop program. The goal was to apply the skills learned in the course to design and develop a functional, responsive, and accessible web page for a fictional coffee shop. It was my first experience building a complete web page.

## üî® Features and Behavior

The web page starts with a call-to-action section inviting users to join a club, followed by an "About Us" section. Next, it features menu and product sections, where each item has an image, title, and price, and can be added to the cart. The page also includes a reservation form, customer reviews, and a contact form, with a map showing the location. The footer provides information such as address, phone number, and operating hours. This page is designed to be responsive, offering an optimized experience for both desktop and mobile devices.
